# variational_bounds_of_mutual_information

We provide the code of various MI estimates in Mi_estimator.py. The-Mi_estimator class is provided to estimate Mutual information. We also provide a correlated guassian example 
to illustrate how to estimate MI with ground truth of MI.

## End-to-End Examples

### Estimation of mutual information for static data

In the case of correlated Gaussian random variables:

We have access to the mutual information:

First go the example directory
```
cd examples/correlated_gaussians/
