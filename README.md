# VBMI: Variational Bounds of Mutual Information

We provide the code of various MI estimates in `mi_estimator.py`.
The `MIEstimator` class is provided to estimate Mutual information. We also provide a correlated gaussian example 
to illustrate how to estimate MI with ground truth of MI.

## End-to-End Examples

### Estimation of mutual information for static data

In the case of correlated Gaussian random variables:

We have access to the mutual information:

First go the example directory
```
cd examples/correlated_gaussians/
```
